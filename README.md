# Daparm Vmware Collection

This repository contains the `daparm.vmware` Ansible Collection.

The collection is intended as a meta collection to have a single pane of glass over the various available vmware ansible content out there. Furthermore it should be used as customization over the already very advanced cloud.vmware_ops collection, to ensure a higher level of operational security.   
There will be a not to be neglected tradeoff between speed and ease of usage, because we basically transfer the reviewed and understood content of cloud.vmware_ops in this collection and add argument_specs to enforce only validated input.
